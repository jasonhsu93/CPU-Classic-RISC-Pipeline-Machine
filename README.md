This project was part of a computer systems/architecture course, focused on enhancing a simple RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) machine by integrating memory for storing instructions and data, and implementing memory-mapped I/O. The project required extending the datapath and finite-state machine controller and introducing advanced concepts like instruction memory and I/O interfacing. 

Tech Stack:
SystemVerilog, ModelSim Compiler, DE1-SoC (ARM7-based motherboard), Quartus Software

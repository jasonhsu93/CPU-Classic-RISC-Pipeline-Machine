This project was a comprehensive exercise in computer systems engineering, focused on enhancing a simple RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) machine by integrating memory for storing instructions and data, and implementing memory-mapped I/O. The project required extending the datapath and finite-state machine controller, and introducing advanced concepts like instruction memory and I/O interfacing. 

Tech Stack:

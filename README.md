Advanced CPU Design and Memory Integration - Lab 7: "Adding Memory and I/O to the Simple RISC Machine"

Institution: University of British Columbia

Project Overview:
This project was a comprehensive exercise in computer systems engineering, focused on enhancing a simple RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) machine by integrating memory for storing instructions and data, and implementing memory-mapped I/O. Conducted as part of the CPEN211 Computer Systems I course, the project required extending the datapath and finite-state machine controller of a previously developed CPU model (from Lab 6), and introducing advanced concepts like instruction memory and I/O interfacing.

Key Objectives and Tasks:

Extending Datapath and Controller: Upgraded the CPU model by adding memory components to the existing datapath and finite-state machine controller. This involved detailed understanding and modifications of CPU internal structures to accommodate memory operations.

Finite-State Machine Modification: Altered the Lab 6 finite-state machine to interface with the newly added instruction memory. This required intricate design and programming skills to ensure seamless integration and functioning of the CPU with the memory component.

Program Counter Implementation: Developed an 8-bit wide program counter, distinct from the ARMv7 architecture, to accurately track and control instruction flow within the CPU.

Memory-Mapped I/O Implementation: Finalized the CPU model by integrating memory-mapped I/O, enabling the CPU to interact with external devices like switches and LEDs. This stage showcased the practical application of theoretical knowledge in interfacing and communication between the CPU and external hardware.

Technologies and Tools Used:

Verilog Programming Language

ModelSim Compiler

DE1-SoC (ARM7-based motherboard)

Quartus Software

Project Outcomes:
The project successfully culminated in a fully functional CPU model capable of performing essential computing tasks, such as executing instructions from memory, handling data with load and store operations, and interacting with external devices through memory-mapped I/O. It demonstrated a profound application of computer engineering principles, including memory management, instruction execution, and hardware interfacing.

Significance for Employers:
This project highlights deep technical skills in CPU architecture and Verilog programming, combined with practical experience in memory and I/O integration. It showcases the ability to handle complex engineering tasks, adapt to evolving technological needs, and integrate theoretical knowledge with practical applications, making it a significant achievement for roles requiring expertise in hardware design, computer architecture, and system engineering.
